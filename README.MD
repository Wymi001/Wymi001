## SMARTRIDE - A smart solution for road transport users

> Working on this to solve a major problem faced by road transport users. Them having to queue up in harsh conditions just to book their travels is not a problem worthy of this age and time.

> I'm therefore working on this project to create a website and application with which users can book their road travels with their preferred road transport company right from the comfort of their homes. All they will be needing are their phones (Android, iOS) and internet connection.

> I aim to add a payment platform where they can make payment, print payment receipt, have a seat number and the date and time of travel. Map will be incorporated into the project and therefore an ETA of the destination.
